  abstract =     {Background Surgical site infection describes an infectious
                  complication of surgical wounds. This single complication is
                  thought to occur in close to 20% of surgical cases. This
                  complication has been described in all kinds of surgical
                  procedure including minimally invasive procedures. Wound
                  irrigation is frequently used as a means of reducing surgical
                  site infection. However, there is lack of solid evidence to
                  support routine wound irrigation. The aim of this review is to
                  provide evidence for the efficacy of routine wound irrigation
                  with normal saline in preventing surgical site infection. The
                  rate of surgical site infection in cases with and without
                  wound irrigation will be analyzed. Methods/design Systematic
                  literature searches will be conducted to identify all
                  published and unpublished studies. The following databases
                  will be searched for citations from inception to present:
                  MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Embase), and CENTRAL (via
                  the Cochrane library). The search strategy will be developed
                  by the research team in collaboration with an experienced
                  librarian and checked by a referee according to the Peer
                  Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) guideline. A
                  draft of the PubMed search strategy could be (irrigation[tiab]
                  OR “Therapeutic Irrigation”[mesh] OR lavage[tiab]) AND
                  (saline[tiab] OR “Sodium Chloride”[mesh] OR sodium
                  chloride[tiab]) NOT (“Comment” [Publication Type] OR “Letter”
                  [Publication Type] OR “Editorial” [Publication Type]). No time
                  limits will be set. The reference lists of eligible articles
                  will be hand searched. Relevant data will be extracted from
                  eligible studies using a previously designed data extraction
                  sheet. Relative risks will be calculated for binary outcomes
                  and mean differences or standardized mean differences, if
                  necessary, for continuous outcomes. For all measures, 95%
                  confidence levels will be calculated. Both arms would be
                  compared with regard to the rate of surgical site infection
                  within 30 days following surgery. We will report the review
