  :END:

Wound dressings are an essential part of care of surgical wounds left
open to heal by secondary intention as wounds that are not regularly
dressed are prone to delayed healing and accumulation of slough. Several
materials have been used to enhance the growth of healthy tissue in
surgical wounds by chemically debriding wound slough. One such material
is the Edinburgh University Solution of Lime which is commonly used in
Pakistan. However, the efficacy of EUSOL gauze in accelerating wound
healing has not been proven in literature as compared to normal saline
soaked gauze. Moreover, it is an expensive solution. There is a need to
objectively establish the true benefit of EUSOL soaked dressings in
comparison to normal saline soaked dressing in order to.

* Introduction

According to Wilkins et al., (ref) debridement, irrigation and cleaning
for the basis of wound care. Debridement involves mechanical removal of
dead tissue, irrigation involves application of fluid streams to the
wound under pressure and cleaning involves application of fluid to the
wound. [Wilkins\_2013] These activities aim to reduce the amount of
non-viable biological material on the surface of the wound. Non-viable
biological material (such as fibrinous debris of dead skin) inhibits
myofibroblasts (that grossly appear as granulation tissue) from growing
into the wound. Wound care activities therefore increase the chances of
wound healing.

To that end, history has seen the application of various materials to
wounds. These materials range from herbal applications like turmeric to
chemicals such as betadine and povidone-iodine. Normal saline and EUSOL
are two materials commonly used in Pakistan. Normal saline consists of
0.9% sodium chloride (or 152 mEq of NaCl) dissolved in water. It is
colorless and odourless solution. It's osmolarity is close to that of
blood making it an "isotonic" fluid.

Smith et al. describe the Edinburgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL)
to be a highly diluted weak acid comprising 1.99 percent EUSOL against
98.01 percent water. The exact constituents of the Edinburgh University
Solution of Lime are 0.54 percent hypochlorous acid, 1.28 percent
calcium biborate and 0.17 percent calcium chloride. Therefore, it is
essentially formed of the chemical reaction of boric and chlorate salts.
In this chemical composition, EUSOL is volatile and decomposes into
hypochlorous acid and sodium chloride. This process is accelerated in
the presence of light therefore EUSOL is stored in photo-resistant
containers. [Smith\_1915]

***  Mode of Action of EUSOL
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: mode-of-action-of-eusol
    :END:

Edmiston et al. found normal saline to have the following advantages: it
hydrates the wound bed. It also reduces the burden of biological
material thereby expediting wound healing process. [Edmiston\_2016]

The antiseptic properties of EUSOL were known as far back as 1990s
whereby experiments show its effectiveness against streptococcus
pyogenes among other pathogens. EUSOL has even been investigated as an
intravenous agent in the treatment of the bubonic plague.
[connor1916eusol]

Recently, EUSOL has also come to be known as a chemical debridement
agent. [Farrow\_1991] It loosens slough (fibrinous, necrotic cellular
debris) from the base of the wound. In doing so, it prevents the
retardation of wound granulation (in-growth of new fibroblasts) and
epithelialization (regeneration of the outermost layer of the skin).
This theoretically reduces the time to wound healing. It also decreases
the chance of wound infection as decreased slough means reduced nidus of
bacterial colonization.

* Rationale

Wounds healing by secondary intention are at risk of developing a layer
of fibrinous exudate (commonly termed as "slough"). Slough has the
potential to arrest the formation of healthy granulation tissue as well
as to elevate the risk of wound super-infection. Meticulous wound
dressing involves addressing the appearance of slough on wound in order
to mitigate the risks of delayed wound healing and wound
super-infection. The Edinburgh University Solution of Lime is commonly
added to dressing routines as a method of chemical debridement of
slough.

Several problems remain with the use of EUSOL. The foremost problem is
that EUSOL is expensive with the cost of averaging to 3 rupees per
milliliter. This price may not be problematic for small wounds that
require once daily dressing. However, the price can climb steeply if the
wounds are of large size or require multiple dressings within 24 hours.

Another problem, as detailed above, is that the chemical composition of
EUSOL degrades with time. Therefore, EUSOL cannot be purchased or stored
in bulk quantity. Not all patients have the capacity to visit a pharmacy
repeatedly to obtained more EUSOL when expired and this is especially a
problem for patients living in remote areas.

Perhaps the most concerning point on using EUSOL for wound care is that
its efficacy has remained controversial for well more than a decade. One
of the first objections to the use of EUSOL for wound dressings appears
in the 1990s. [Burton\_1992, Patton\_1992] These objections are narrated
in letters to the editors where doctors describe events where they have
been approached by other healthcare providers either discouraging or
actively refusing the use of EUSOL in patient care. The NICE guidelines
(NICE, 2019) categorically prohibits the use of EUSOL on wounds that are
healing by secondary intention.

However, it is difficult to synthesize an evidence based opinion
regarding EUSOL from the literature. To the knowledge of the authors,
there exists no study directly comparing EUSOL dressing with simple
gauze soaked in normal saline. Rather, all available studies focus on
comparison of EUSOL dressing with a variety of other dressing materials.
Table 1 summarizes these studies (see Appendix 1).

It is immediately obvious that no unified conclusion can be drawn from
these studies. There is no single, uniform measure of wound healing
across studies to allow objective comparison of the relative performance
of EUSOL. Furthermore, none of the dressings materials described in
these studies are commonly used in Pakistan for dressing wounds healing
by secondary intention.

In summary, the rationale of this study is the need for effective and
inexpensive dressing to address the slough that frequently appears on
surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.

***  Study Hypotheses

Null: There is no difference in the healing rate of open surgical wounds
dressed with EUSOL dressings or with Normal Saline dressings by
secondary intention

Alternate: The healing rate of open surgical wounds dressed with EUSOL
dressings is greater than that of open surgical wounds dressed with
Normal Saline dressings by secondary intention

***  Primary Objective

To determine effectiveness of Eusol dressing on the healing rate of open
surgical wounds compared to normal saline dressing by secondary
intention.

* Methods and Materials

** Operational Definitions

- *Wound Healing Rate*: The value θ of the delayed exponential curve
  plotted on a graph of advance of wound margin towards the wound center
  against time since surgery for a set of seven or more wound
  measurements such that:

  - The two longest, mutually perpendicular diameters of the wound, a
    and b measured in mm, are used to calculate the area of the wound, S
    in mm^{2}, using the formula

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  \begin{equation}

  \frac{\pi}{4}a\_i\cdot b\_i

  \end{equation} and the perimeter, p in mm, of the wound using the
  formula

  \begin{equation}

  \pi[\frac{3}{4}(a\_i+b\_i)-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{a\_0\cdot b\_0}]

  \end{equation}
#+END_QUOTE

- The advance of wound margin, in mm, towards the center of the wound is
  calculated using the formula

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  \begin{equation}

  2\frac{S\_0}{p\_0T}[mm/day]

  \end{equation}
#+END_QUOTE

- The seven measurements are taken at an interval of one week.
  [Cukjati\_2001]

- The predicted time, in days, for a given wound to reduce to 5% of its
  initial area or the predicted time for a given wound to reduce to less
  than 100 mm^{2} which ever is smaller. This definition has been
  adapted from Cukjati et al. [Cukjati\_2001]

- *Normal Saline Dressing*: The practice of applying povidone-iodine to
  wound edges followed by washing wounds with at least 500 cc of normal
  saline before applying gauze in a clean or sterile fashion

- *EUSOL Dressing*: The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound
  edges followed by washing wounds with at least 500 cc of normal saline
  before applying gauze soaked in EUSOL in a clean or sterile fashion

- *Open Surgical Wound*: Surgical wound where skin has not been
  approximated by staples or sutures

- *Wound Care Practitioner*: Wound Nurses, surgeons and/or surgical
  residents with at least one year of experience in dressing surgical
  wounds healing by secondary intention

- *Diabetic Patient*: Patients with reduced ability to auto-regulate
  serum glucose levels as defined by guidelines of the National
  Institute of Health and Care Excellence, United Kingdom [ICGT\_2015]:

  - Fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL

  - Random blood glucose level > 200 mg/dL

  - HbA1c > 6.5 mg/dL

  - Taking oral hypoglycemic agents

  - Taking subcutaneous insulin injection

- *Smoking Status* and *Cigarette Usage*: Cigarette usage as defined by
  the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA [CDC\_Smoking]

     1. An adult who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her
        lifetime, and who now smokes every day. Previously called a
        “regular smoker”.

     *Former smoker*

  2. ** Study Design
        :PROPERTIES:
        :CUSTOM_ID: study-design
        :END:

This will be a single center, double-blinded, non-placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study with balanced randomisation (1:1). The study will
be conducted in Karachi, Pakistan whereby patients will be followed
during both in-hospital stay as well as outpatients for a total of six
weeks after surgery.

The unblinded data collected from each group will be reviewed by an
independent investigator for patient safety. This independent
investigator will assess each group for frequency of wound infections
and of wounds that are non-healing. The study will be halted if 10% or
more patients in either group suffer from wound infections or if 10 % or
more patients in either group suffer from non-healing wounds.

** Study Setting
This study setting will be the Aga Khan University Hospital for
inpatients as well as patients receiving home healthcare in the city of
Karachi.

/*Preparation of Cleansing Agents (EUSOL and Normal Saline)*/

** Study Procedures
This study will involve the blinded use of normal saline and EUSOL in
their assessment of wound healing capabilities. To that end, these
solutions will be prepared, packaged and marked for use by the Aga Khan
University Pharmacy Department.

Patients who have undergone any abdominal or limb surgery will be
recruited (see 4.8) and assessed for eligibility (see sections 4.5 &
4.6). Eligible patients will be offered enrolment in the trial using
written informed consent Appendix-??. The number of patients who are
excluded from the study or who refuse to participate will be noted.
Those who consent will be randomized to either the normal saline group
or the EUSOL group as described in 8.

Once randomized, the following details will be recorded for all patients
using the "New Patient Registration" (see 9)

- the patient's age and gender

- the surgery that the patient underwent and the date of that surgery

- whether the patient is a diabetic, smoker or has peripheral vascular
  disease

- the longest dimension of the wound and the second-longest dimension
  that is perpendicular to the first

Following initial registration, patients will receive the allocated
treatment as described in 8. followed once a week for a total of 7
weeks. At each follow-up, the following details will be recorded using
the "Follow-Up Wound Assessment" Form (see 9)

- the longest dimension of the wound and the second-longest dimension
  that is perpendicular to the first

- whether the consultant surgeon of that patient has decided to close
  the wound surgically and the date of that decision

- whether the consultant surgeon of that patient has decided to retake
  the patient to OR for a re-look debridement and the date of that
  decision.

All wound assessments will be done by a wound nurse with at least one
year of experience or by a consultant surgeon. At the end of the wound
assessment period the collected data will be analyzed as per the
analysis plan outlined below (see 4.13). The number of patients lost to
follow-up and the number of patients who did not receive the allocated
treatment during the course of the study will be noted. These patients
will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The entire study
procedure is summarized in the consort diagram (see 6).

#+END_{COMMENT}

** Inclusion Criteria
Tis study will include adult, post-operative patients with surgical
wounds of the abdomen and limbs that have been left to heal by secondary
intention.

** Exclusion Criteria
Patients with the following types of wounds will be excluded from this
study:

- Wounds resulting from and/or complicated by viscero-cutaneous fistula:
  These wounds involve an abnormal connection between the epithelium of
  the skin and the epithelium of a hollow viscus that normally produces
  a bodily fluid. Wound care of viscero-cutaneous fistulas involves
  maneuvers to abate the physical and chemical effects of the bodily
  fluid to the skin. Such maneuvers have little or no connection with
  EUSOL. Therefore, wounds related to viscero-cutaneous fistulas are
  beyond the scope of this study.
- Wounds resulting from pre-existing dermatological pathology, for
  example (but not limited to) psoriasis: Wounds resulting from
  pre-existing dermatological pathology have a different natural history
  of healing as compared to wounds on otherwise normal skin. Management
  of such wounds typically involves medical regimens tailored to curtail
  the pathology causing the wound and wound healing is directly
  correlated to controlling that pathology. Therefore, these wounds are
  beyond the scope of this study.
- Wounds in patients on corticosteroid therapy
- Wounds in patients undergoing re-look debridement of the wound being
  studied

** Outcome Measure
The main outcome measure of this study will be the difference in mean
healing rate between the normal saline and EUSOL groups. Healing rate
will be calculated as defined by Cukjati et al. (see 4.1).

** Sampling Technique
This study will recruit patients using consecutive sampling. Patients
will be identified for recruitment on a daily basis using the Main
Operating Room and Day care Surgery Operating Room case list Recruitment
will be attempted 24 - 48 hours after surgery.

** Randomization Technique
The patients will be randomly assigned to one of following two parallel
groups in a 1:1 ratio:

- Normal Saline Dressings

- EUSOL Dressings

Randomization will be stratified by diabetic status, smoking status and
presence of peripheral arterial disease. Following stratification,
randomization will be done using block randomization technique using
blocks of four, six and eight patients.

Randomization will be done by the Aga Khan University Clinical Trials
Unit as described in 8. This randomization table was generated using the
online tool Sealed Envelope [simple\_rand\_serv].

** TODO /involve CTU to elaborate process/ Blinding Technique
Preparation of the aliquots of normal saline and EUSOL will be conducted
by the Aga Khan Hospital Pharmacy Department. EUSOL is a photosensitive
compound (see 2) and must therefore be stored in tinted reagent bottles
to prevent decomposition. To prevent identification of EUSOL from normal
saline, aliquots of normal saline will also be stored in tinted reagent
bottles.

Following preparation, Aga Khan University Clinical Trials Unit will
label the bottles. The labels will state the contents of the bottle and
a randomization code from the table described in 8.

Following labelling, aliquots will be allocated to patients who have
been randomized to the same treatment arm as their contents. The
Clinical Trials Unit will note the patient to whom each aliquot has been
allocated on the randomization table next to the respective
randomization code.

** TODO /re-estimate sample size/ Sample Size
The sample size for this study had been calculated on the basis of the
work of Bajaj et al. [Bajaj\_2009] who compared the rate of wound
healing in patients treated with sugar coated bandages with that of
patients treated with EUSOL dressing. To the authors' best knowledge,
there is no other study that more closely resembles the objectives of
this study. Therefore, the authors saw fit to base sample size
calculation upon this study.

Based on this study, the anticipated proportion of patients with wound
healing in the standard dressing group (case group) is 77% and the
anticipated proportion of patients with wound healing in the EUSOL
dressing group (control group). Thus the relative risk of wound healing
from normal saline dressing versus EUSOL dressing is expected to be 1.2.

The sample size was calculated using OpenEpi Software version 3.01. The
sample size was calculated using the above anticipated proportions as
well as significance of 5%, power of 80% and an inflation of 10% to
account for non-response. The minimum sample size required was
calculated to be 532 patients in total: 266 patients in Group 1
(standard dressing) and 266 patients in Group 2 (EUSOL dressing).

**  Study Duration
In order to estimate the study duration, the authors submitted a request to the
Aga Khan University Health Information Systems (HIS) in search of the number of
cases that resulted in surgical wounds of the abdomen and limbs left to heal by
secondary intention. The number of case records bearing the following ICD-9-CM
codes in the last year were queried from the hospital database via The Aga Khan
University Health Information Systems (HIS):

- Exploratory Laparotomy: 54.11 = 231
- Re-open Laparotomy: 54.12​ = 23
- Reversal of Colostomy: 46.52 = 35
- Carbuncle: 68.00 - 68.09 = 50
- Incision and Drainage of Abscess: 86.04 = 176
- Above Knee Amputation: 84.17 = 29
- Below Knee Amputation: 84.15 = 62

This query resulted in a total of 606 cases which exceeds the required
sample size within one year. Accounting for the 7 week follow-up required for each
patient, this study is expected to take a maximum of 18 months to
complete.

**  Data Analysis
By measuring wounds with the method as defined by Cukjati et al. (see
Operational Definitions), each wound will have a set of 7 measurements.
These measurements will then be plotted on a graph of wound area against
time. This graph follows a delayed exponential curve having coefficient
θ. The coefficient θ will be calculated for all patients by fitting
their individual wound measurements to the delayed exponential curve.
Wounds having a faster healing rate will have a higher value of θ.

Student's t-test will be used to detect any significant difference in θ
of patients in normal saline group and those in the EUSOL group.

Study Title: Comparison of wound healing rate between EUSOL and Normal
Saline Dressings

Principal Investigator: Dr. Rehman Alvi

Name of Organization: Aga Khan University Hospital

This informed consent has two parts

- Information Sheet containing details of the investigation that will be
  conducted during this study

- Certificate of Consent on which you may give your signature if you
  agree to participate

Part I: Information Sheet

I, Dr. Naveed Aman Pasha, work for Aga Khan University Hospital. We are
doing a study on wounds that have been left open after surgery. We want
to see if wounds heal faster if dressing is done with gauze soaked with
normal saline as compared to gauze soaked with Edinburgh University
Solution of Lime (Eusol solution).

*Purpose of the Study*

Sometimes people undergo surgeries whereby surgeons do not close the
wound with sutures but rather leave it open to heal by itself. This is
usually because the surgery was done on an area that was dirty and/or
infected so it is at higher risk of getting infected if closed with
sutures. Such wounds are normally washed daily with normal saline after
which they are dressed with gauze soaked in normal saline or EUSOL.
EUSOL is thought to uproot the dead skin which develops during healing
process to avoid stopping new, healthy skin from growing into the wound.
However, EUSOL is an expensive solution. Moreover, the efficacy of EUSOL
has been questioned world over. This research will compare the healing
rate of wounds dressed with gauze soaked in EUSOL with that of those
dressed with gauze soaked in normal saline.

*Participant Selection*

We are inviting all patients with open surgical wounds after their
surgery to participate in this study.

*Voluntary Participation*

Your participation in this study is voluntary. Your choice to
participate in this study does not affect the service you receive at the
Aga Khan University Hospital. If you decide not to participate in this
study you will continue to receive treatment routinely offered for
dressing of open surgical wounds regarding which you will be informed
later.

*Type of Research Investigation*

This research will involve a nurse or doctor measuring your wound during
dressing change once a week for a total of six weeks. Measuring your
wound will involve holding a ruler or measuring tape up to your wound
and reading the value. It is a painless procedure.

*Description of Process and Duration of Study*

In this research, you will be assigned to one of two groups whereby your
wound will be dressed with gauze soaked in normal saline or gauze soaked
with EUSOL. Neither you nor your nurse/doctor will know which of the two
your wound is being dressed with. This is necessary in order to keep the
research process objective. Wound dressing will be done daily for a
total of six weeks whereby your wound be measured every week as detailed
above. After six weeks have elapsed and all measurements are complete
your care will be resumed by your surgeon who will instruct you on how
to dress your wound(s).

*Risks*

Any risk can appear during the study. The most prominent risks is wound
infection Your progress will be monitored by our team of healthcare providers
who will address any concerns if and when they arise.

*Benefits*

Your participation will also help us find out if doctors should actually be
prescribing EUSOL which is an expensive solution. The results of this study can
then be published so that other medical experts can benefit at large.

*Reimbursements*

As part of participation in this study, you will be reimbursed for your follow
up visits to the wound clinic as well as wound dressings during those visits for
the first 7 weeks after your surgery.If you remain in hospital for any time
period during the first seven weeks, you will be reimbursed for the dressings on
the day of week on which your wound measurements are taken as part of the study.

 You will not continue to be reimbursed after the first 7 weeks have elapsed. Furthermore,
 your participation in the study will end if your wound is determined to have
 become infected and/or needs re-look debridement during the course of the first
 7 weeks after surgery. Your surgeon will be informed at this point and you will
 cease to get any reimbursements.

*************** Need to coordinate a grant funding source
*************** END


*Confidentiality*

The persons involve in conducting this research will not share the
identity of or disclose any information regarding patients who have
agreed to participate in this study. The data collected during this
research will be kept confidential. A stringent procedure is in place to
ensure that data collected during this research is used only by persons
conducting this study.

We are offering you participation in this study because you have
undergone a surgery after which your wound(s) has been left open to
heal. If you agree to participate in this study, you will be randomly
assigned to one of two groups: dressings with EUSOL or dressings with
normal saline.

Once you have been assigned, a doctor or nurse will dress your wound(s)
with gauze soaked in either of EUSOL or normal saline everyday. Once a
week, the nurse/doctor will measure your wound with a measuring tape and
take a picture. This will continue for a total of six weeks.
