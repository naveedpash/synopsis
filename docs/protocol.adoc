== Introduction

Smith et al. describe the Edinburgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL) to be
a highly diluted weak acid comprising 1.99 percent EUSOL against 98.01 percent
water. The exact constituents of the Edinburgh University Solution of Lime are
0.54 percent hypochlorous acid, 1.28 percent calcium biborate and 0.17 percent
calcium chloride. Therefore, it is essentially formed of the chemical reaction
of boric and chlorate salts. In this chemical composition, EUSOL is volatile
and decomposes into hypochlorous acid and sodium chloride. This process is
accelerated in the presence of light therefore EUSOL is stored in
photo-resistant containers. cite:[Smith_1915]

=== Mode of Action

The antiseptic properties of EUSOL were known as far back as 1990s whereby
experiments show its effectiveness against streptococcus pyogenes among other
pathogens. EUSOL has even been investigated as an intravenous agent in the
treatment of the bubonic plague. cite:[connor1916eusol]

Recently, EUSOL has also come to be known as a chemical debridement agent.
cite:[Farrow_1991] It loosens slough (fibrinous, necrotic cellular debris) from
the base of the wound. In doing so, it prevents the retardation of wound
granulation (ingrowth of new fibroblasts) and epithelialisation (regeneration
of the outermost layer of the skin). This theoretically reduces the time to
wound healing. It also decreases the chance of wound infection as decreased
slough means reduced nidus of bacterial colonisation.

== Rationale

Wounds healing by secondary intention are at risk of developing a layer of
fibrinous exudate (commonly termed as "slough"). Slough has the potential to
arrest the formation of healthy granulation tissue as well as to elevate the
risk of wound super-infection. Meticulous wound dressing involves addressing the
appearance of slough on wound in order to mitigate the risks of delayed wound
healing and wound super-infection. The Edinburgh University Solution of Lime is
commonly added to dressing routines as a method of chemical debridement of
slough.

Several problems remain with the use of EUSOL. The foremost problem is that
EUSOL is expensive with the cost of averaging to 3 rupees per milliliter. This
price may not be problematic for small wounds that require once daily dressing.
However the price can climb steeply if the wounds are of large size or require
multiple dressings within 24 hours.

Another problem, as detailed above, is that the chemical composition of EUSOL
degrades with time. Therefore EUSOL cannot be purchased or stored in bulk
quantity. Not all patients have the capacity to visit a pharmacy repeatedly to
obtained more EUSOL when expired and this is especially a problem for patients
living in remote areas.

Perhaps the most concerning point on using EUSOL for wound care is that its
efficacy has remained controversial for well more than a decade. One of the
first objections to the use of EUSOL for wound dressings appears in the 1990s.
cite:[Burton_1992]+[Patton_1992] These objections are narrated in letters to the
editors where doctors describe events where they have been approached by other
healthcare providers either discouraging or actively refusing the use of EUSOL
in patient care. The NICE guidelines (NICE, 2019) categorically prohibits the
use of EUSOL on wounds that are healing by secondary intention.

However, it is difficult to synthesize an evidence based opinion regarding EUSOL
from the literature. To the knowledge of the authors, there exists no study
directly comparing EUSOL dressing with simple gauze soaked in normal saline.
Rather, all available studies focus on comparison of EUSOL dressing with a
variety of other dressing materials. Table 1 summarises these studies.

Table: Summary of literature comparing EUSOL with various other wound dressing
materials.

It is immediately obvious that no unified conclusion can be drawn from these
studies. There is no single, uniform measure of wound healing across studies to
allow objective comparison of the relative performance of EUSOL. Furthermore,
none of the dressings materials described in these studies are commonly used in
Pakistan for dressing wounds healing by secondary intention.

In summary, the rationale of this study is the need for effective and
inexpensive dressing to address the slough that frequently appears on surgical
wounds healing by secondary intention.

=== Study Hypotheses

The null hypothesis is that the healing rate of open surgical wounds dressed
with EUSOL dressings is not greater than that of open surgical wounds dressed
with Normal Saline dressings.

The alternate hypothesis is that the healing rate of open surgical wounds
dressed with EUSOL dressings is greater than that of open surgical wounds
dressed with Normal Saline dressings

== Methods and Materials

=== Operational Definitions

* *Wound Healing Rate*: A wound care practitioner will measure the two longest
  diameters for every wound, _a_ and _b_, such that _a_ and _b_ are mutually
  perpendicular. The diameters will be measured in millimeters. The diameters
  will be measured once every week for a total of six weeks from the time of the
  patients' surgery. The wound healing rate will then be calculated as the
  advance of the wound margin towards the center of the wound, in mm per day,
  using the formula asciimath:[2S_0//p_0T] where asciimath:[S_0] is the area
  of the wound on the zeroth day given by asciimath:[pi/4*a_0*b_0] and
  asciimath:[p_0] is the perimeter of the wound on the zeroth day given by
  asciimath:[pi[3/4(a_0+b_0)-1/2sqrt(a_0*b_0)]] and asciimath:[T] is the
  predicted time of wound closure cite:[Cukjati_2001]

* *Predicted Time of Wound Closure*: The predicted time, in days, for
  a given wound to reduce to 5% of its initial area or the predicted time
  for a given wound to reduce to less than 100 mm^2^ which ever is
  smaller. This definition has been adapted from Cukjati et al. and will
  be calculated according to their method. cite:[Cukjati_2001]

* *Diabetic Patient*: Patients with reduced ability to auto-regulate serum
  glucose levels as defined by guidelines of the National Institute of Health
  and Care Excellence, United Kingdom cite:[ICGT_2015]:

  ** Documented fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL
  ** Documented random blood glucose level > 200 mg/dL
  ** Documented HbA1c > 6.5 mg/dL
  ** Taking oral hypoglycemic agents
  ** Taking subcutaneous insulin injection

* *Smoking Status and Cigarette Usage*: Cigarette usage as defined by the
  Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA cite:[CDC_Smoking]

  ** Every day smoker: An adult who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his
     or her lifetime, and who now smokes every day. Previously called a
     “regular smoker”.

  ** Former smoker: An adult who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his
     or her lifetime but who had quit smoking at the time of interview.

  ** Never smoker: An adult who has never smoked, or who has smoked less
     than 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime.

* *Normal Saline Dressing*: The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound
  edges followed by washing wounds with at least 500 cc of normal saline before
  applying gauze in a clean or sterile fashion

* *EUSOL Dressing*: The practice of applying povidone-iodine to wound edges
  followed by washing wounds with at least 500 cc of normal saline before
  applying gauze soaked in EUSOL in a clean or sterile fashion

* *Open Surgical Wound*: Surgical wound where skin has not been approximated by
  staples or sutures

* *Wound Care Practitioner*: Wound Nurses, surgeons and/or surgical residents
  with at least one year of experience in dressing surgical wounds healing by
  secondary intention

=== Primary Objective

To determine whether the healing rate of open surgical wounds healing by
secondary intention is significantly greater with EUSOL dressing as compared to
normal saline dressing.

=== Outcome Measure

The main outcome measure of this study will be mean healing rate. Healing
rate will be calculated as defined by Cukjati et al. The authors have
briefly paraphrase this method of calculation in the "Operational
Definitions" section for the benefit of the reader who is referred to the
full text for complete details. The mean healing rate of the patients
treated with normal saline dressings and patients treated with EUSOL
dressings will be compared for any significant difference.

=== Study Design

This will be a single center, double-blinded, non-placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study with balanced randomisation (1:1). The study will be
conducted in Karachi, Pakistan whereby patients will be followed during
both in-hospital stay as well as outpatients for a total of six weeks
after surgery.

The unblinded data collected from each group will be reviewed by an
independent Data Monitoring Committee for patient safety. This independent
Data Monitoring Committee will be responsible for interim analysis of the
data that may This study will follow surgical wounds left to heal by
secondary intention. Therefore the study setting will be the Aga Khan
University Hospital for inpatients as well as patients receiving home
healthcare in the city of Karachi.

=== Inclusion Criteria

This study will include adult, post-operative patients with surgical wounds of
the abdomen and limbs that have been left to heal by secondary intention.

=== Exclusion Criteria

Patients with the following types of wounds will be excluded from this study:

* Wounds resulting from and/or complicated by viscero-cutaneous fistula: These
  wounds involve an abnormal connection between the epithelium of the skin and
  the epithelium of a hollow viscus that normally produces a bodily fluid. Wound
  care of viscero-cutaneous fistulas involves maneuvers to abate the physical
  and chemical effects of the bodily fluid to the skin. Such maneuvers have
  little or no connection with EUSOL. Therefore, wounds related to
  viscero-cutaneous fistulas are beyond the scope of this study.

* Wounds resulting from pre-existing dermatological pathology, for example (but
  not limited to) psoriasis: Wounds resulting from pre-existing dermatological
  pathology have a different natural history of healing as compared to wounds on
  otherwise normal skin.  Management of such wounds typically involves medical
  regimens tailored to curtail the pathology causing the wound and wound healing
  is directly correlated to controlling that pathology. Therefore, these wounds
  are beyond the scope of this study.

=== Sampling Technique

This study will recruit patients using consecutive sampling. Informed
consent will be taken from patients who have undergone surgery whereby the
surgical wound was left open. Recruitment will be attempted immediately in the
immediate post-operative period which spans 24 - 48 hours after surgery.

=== Randomisation Technique

The patients will be randomly assigned to one of following two parallel groups
in a 1:1 ratio:

* Normal Saline Dressings
* EUSOL Dressings

Randomisation will be stratified by diabetic status, smoking status and
presence of peripheral arterial disease. Following stratification,
randomisation will be done using block randomisation technique using
blocks of four, six and eight patients as follows:

|===

Patients will be selected upon presentation to the Aga Khan University Hospital
using block permutation method. Two blocks of 4 subjects each will be used.
Upon selection, patients will be randomised to one of the following two study
groups:

Randomisation will be stratified according to diabetic status. Cases will be
matched with controls on the basis of diabetic status, smoking status and wound
size.

=== Sample Size

The sample size for this study had been calculated on the basis of the work of
Bajaj et al. cite:[Bajaj_2009] who compared the rate of wound healing in
patients treated with sugar coated bandages with that of patients treated with
EUSOL dressing. To the authors' best knowledge, there is no other study that
more closely resembles the objectives of this study. Therefore, the authors saw
fit to base sample size calculation upon this study.

Based on this study, the anticipated proportion of patients with wound healing
in the standard dressing group (case group) is 77% and the anticipated
proportion of patients with wound healing in the EUSOL dressing group (control
group).  Thus the relative risk of wound healing from normal saline dressing
versus EUSOL dressing is expected to be 1.2.

The sample size was calculated using OpenEpi Software version 3.01.  The sample
size was calculated using the above anticipated proportions as well as
significance of 5%, power of 80% and an inflation of 10% to account for
non-response. The minimum sample size required was calculated to be 532 patients
in total: 266 patients in Group 1 (standard dressing) and 266 patients in Group
2 (EUSOL dressing).
