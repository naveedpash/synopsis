# Abstract

-- need to fill --

# Introduction

Undertaking surgical procedures involves a decision making process shared
between the surgeon and the patient. Clear understanding of the procedure, its
risks and benefits is essential for patients to make an informed decision.
Therefore, patients need to know not only what complications can take place but
also the probability of those complications in order to weigh them against the
benefits. Knowing the probability of complications becomes especially vital in
emergency setting when patients are confronted with a sudden decision where both
affirmation and negation have drastic consequences. Unfortunately, there exists
no calculator for post-operative morbidity and mortality in the emergency
setting for the entire South-East Asia Region. 

# Rationale

-- need to fill --

# Objective

The primary objective of this study is assess the accuracy of the ACS NSQIP risk
calculator in estimating the probability of post-operative mortality and
morbidity in patients of the Pakistani population undergoing elective and
emergent surgeries.

# Operational Definitions

These operational definitions have been adapted from the [ACS risk calculator
website](https://riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator/PatientInfo.jsp)

1. Functional Status

- Independent: the patient does not require assistance from another person for
  any activities of daily living. This includes a person who is able to function
  independently with prosthetics, equipment or devices
- Partially dependent: the patient requires some assistance from another person
  for activities of daily
- Totally dependent: the patient requires total assistance for all activities of
  daily living

2. ASA classification

- ASA 1: Normal healthy patient
- ASA 2: Patient with mild systemic disease
- ASA 3: Patient with severe systemic disease
- ASA 4: Patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life
- ASA 5: Moribund patient who is no expected to survive without operation

3. Steroid Use

This includes any administration of steroids greater a single pulse dose or a
short taper course less than 10 days.

4. Ascites

The presence of fluid accumulation in peritoneal cavity noted on physical
examination, abdominal ultrasound or abdominal CT/MRI.

5. Systemic Sepsis

Any patient displaying signs and symptoms of:

- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome
- Sepsis
- Septic shock

6. Ventilator Requirement

This does not include patients requiring CPAP for sleep apnoea.

7. Disseminated Cancer

The patient has a primary cancer that has metastasized to a major organ AND
meets at least one of the following:

- active treatment for the cancer within one year of the surgery date. If the surgical procedure is the treatment for the
metastatic cancer, answer "Yes"
- the patient has elected not to receive treatment for the metastatic disease
- the patient's metastatic cancer has been deemed untreatable

Does not include patients with

- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
- Chronic myelogenous leukemia,
- Lymphomas of stages I through III or multiple myeloma

8. Presence of Diabetes

This will not include patients whose diabetes is controlled by diet alone.

9. Congestive Heart Failure

- Newly diagnosed CHF within previous 30 days
- Diagnosis of chronic CHF with signs or symptoms of CHF in the 30 days prior to
  proposed surgery

10. Current Smoker

A current smoker will not include patients who consumed cigars, pipes or chewing
tobacco. 

11. Severe COPD

Severe COPD will be defined as:

- Functional disability from COPD
- Hospitalisation in the past fro treatment of COPD
- Chronic bronchodilator therapy with oral or inhaled agents
- FEV<sub>1</sub> of < 75% of predicted
- Does not include patients whose only pulmonary disease is asthma
- Does not include patients with diffuse interstitial fibrosis or sarcoidosis

12. Requirement for Dialysis

- Acute or chronic renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis,
  hemofiltration or ultrafiltration within 2 weeks of proposed surgery
- If a patient refuses dialysis but requires it, the answer will be "yes"

13. Acute Renal Failure

A clinical condition associated with rapid decline of the kidney function. The
patient meets one of the following:

- Increased BUN on two measurements AND two creatinine results > 3mg/dL
- Surgeon or physician has documented Acute Renal Failure AND one of the
  following
  - Increased BUN on two measurements
  - Two Cr results > 3 mg/dL

# Methods

Approval for the study will be taken from the Ethical Review Committee of the
Aga Khan University Hospital.

## Study Design

This will be a single centre descriptive longitudinal study. 

## Study Setting

The study conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital in the Departments of
Surgery and Emergency Medicine. Surgeries will be performed in the operating
rooms. Patients will be observed postoperatively in the General Ward, High
Dependency Units or outpatient clinics (based on patient condition).

## Inclusion criteria

The study population will comprise of adult patients undergoing any of the
following surgical procedures:

- Thyroidectomy (total or partial)
- Parathyroidectomy
- Diversion or resective colonic surgery
  - Right hemicolectomy
  - Left hemicolectomy
  - Total colectomy
  - Lower Anterior Resection
  - Abdomino-perineal resection
- Pancreatic Procedures
  - Whipple procedure
  - Distal Pancreatectomy
- 

Pertinent patient variables will be:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Functional Status
- Whether surgery is emergent
- ASA Class
- Steroid use for chronic condition
- Ascites within last 30 days prior to presentation
- Systematic sepsis within previous 48 hours
- Presence of congestive heart failure on presentation
- Presence of acute renal failure on presentation
- Presence of disseminated cancer
- Presence of diabetes (none, on oral hypoglycemics, on insulin)
- Presence of hypertension requiring medication
- Current Smoker for last one year
- Presence of severe COPD
- Dialysis Dependent
- Ventilator requirement 48 hours prior to planned surgery

Data will be gathered prospectively. These variables will be used to create
three logistic regression models for mortality, post-operative intensive care
need and post-operative ventilator need respectively. These variables will also
be used to create a linear regression model for estimating the hospital stay in
days.

## Duration of Study

One to two years after the approval of synopsis.

## Sample Size

-- to be calculated --

## Duration of Study

Non-probability consecutive sampling.

## Data Analysis

The statistical analysis will be performed using the R statistical programming
language and environment. Distributions of the predicted probabilities mortality
as well as each morbidity will be plotted. Receiver operating curves will be
plotted for these distributions and the area under the curve will be calculated.

# Expected Outcomes of the Study

Provision of surgical risk calculator in the emergency setting will be
a tremendous asset to patients. The risk calculator will assist in weighing the
risks and benefits of the emergency surgery by providing the probability of
adverse outcomes. It will aid patients in justifying the cost of the surgical
procedure. It will aid surgeons in tailoring selection of candidates for surgery
in cases where benefits of surgery are equivocal.

# Dissemination of Results

Results are intended to be submitted for publication as
free access so that the risk calculator may be freely available to surgeons
across for application. Study results will be reported in accordance with the
STROBE guidelines.
