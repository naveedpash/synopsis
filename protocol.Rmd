# Abstract

Clear understanding of the risks and benefits of any surgical procedure is
crucial for both surgeon and patient when committing to any surgical treatment.
Surgeons are interested in the ability of the patient to survive the procedure
without harm. Patients are interested primarily in the gravity of the surgery
and secondarily in the expected length of hospital stay in order to manage their
lives according to what best suits patient care. Unfortunately there exists no
validated surgical risk calculator for the Pakistani population. The objective
of this study is to ascertain the accuracy of the American College of Surgeons
National Survey on Quality Improvement Project risk calculator in predicting
intra- and postoperative adverse outcomes as well as postoperative length of
stay.

# Introduction

Undertaking surgical procedures involves a decision making process shared
between the surgeon and the patient. Clear understanding of the procedure,
its risks and benefits is essential for patients to make an informed
decision. Therefore, patients need to know not only what complications can
take place but also the probability of those complications in order to
weigh them against the benefits. Knowing the probability of complications
becomes especially vital in emergency setting when patients are confronted
with a sudden decision where both affirmation and negation have drastic
consequences. Unfortunately, there exists no calculator for post-operative
morbidity and mortality in the emergency setting for the entire South-East
Asia Region. 

_TO DO_: Current Literature Review is based only on PubMed Search, can do
more extensive literature review

# Rationale

-- need to fill --

# Objective

The primary objective of this study is assess the accuracy of the ACS NSQIP risk
calculator in estimating the probability of post-operative mortality and
morbidity in patients of the Pakistani population undergoing elective and
emergent surgeries.

# Operational Definitions

These operational definitions have been adapted from the [CARES Surgical Risk
Calculator](https://carescalculator.com)

1. Nature of Surgery

- Elective: definitive and/or therapeutic surgical intervention planned at a
  specific date after pre-operative considerations
- Emergency: unplanned surgical intervention without there is an imminent threat
  to life


2. ASA classification

- ASA 1: Normal healthy patient
- ASA 2: Patient with mild systemic disease
- ASA 3: Patient with severe systemic disease
- ASA 4: Patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life
- ASA 5: Moribund patient who is no expected to survive without operation  

3. Anemia Score


- Mild anaemia – In men, Hb between 11.0-12.9g/dL; in women, Hb between 11.0-11.9g/dL
- Moderate/severe anaemia – Hb≤ 10.9g/dL
Defined according to WHO definition

4. Congestive Heart Failure

- Newly diagnosed CHF within previous 30 days
- Diagnosis of chronic CHF with signs or symptoms of CHF in the 30 days prior to
  proposed surgery

5. Ischemic Heart Disease

6. Surgical site infection (SSI)

-  Superficial Incisional SSI: infection that involves only skin or subcutaneous
   tissue of the incision. It also includes either: purulent drainage, positive
   culture, signs/symptoms of infection and the incision is deliberately opened
   by the surgeon or diagnosis by the attending physician
-  Deep Incisional SSI: infection that appears to be related to the operation
   and involves deep soft tissues (for example, fascial and muscle layers) of
   the incision. It also includes either: purulent drainage, spontaneous
   dehiscence, deliberate opening by the surgeon, abscess involving the deep
   incision, or diagnosis by the attending physician
-  Organ Space SSI: infection that involves any part of the anatomy (for
   example, organs or spaces), other than the incision, which was opened or
   manipulated during an operation. It also includes either: purulent drainage,
   positive culture, abscess, or diagnosis by the attending physician

7. Urinary tract infection

- Bladder infection, diagnosed using a combination of clinical symptoms and
  laboratory confirmation (e.g., urine culture, pyuria, positive dipstick) or
  initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy

8. Venous thromboembolism / blood clot

- The identification of a new thrombus within the venous system, described in
  studies as present in the superficial or deep venous systems but requires
  therapy. This diagnosis is confirmed by a duplex, venogram, CT scan or other
  imaging modality, AND the patient requires treatment with anticoagulation
  therapy and/or placement of a vena cava filter or clipping of the vena cava

9. Return to Operating Room

- Return to the operating room for additional surgery that was not planned at
  the time of the initial surgery 

10. Serious Complication

- Cardiac arrest
- Myocardial infarction
- Pneumonia
- Progressive renal insufficiency
- Acute renal failure
- Pulmonary embolism
- Deep venous thrombosis
- Return to the operating room
- Deep incisional SSI
- Organ space SSI
- Systemic
- Sepsis
- Unplanned intubation
- UTI
- Wound disruption as defined previously

# Methods

Approval for the study will be taken from the Ethical Review Committee of the
Aga Khan University Hospital.

## Study Design

This will be a single centre descriptive longitudinal study. 

## Study Setting

The study conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital in the Departments of
Surgery and Emergency Medicine. Surgeries will be performed in the operating
rooms. Patients will be observed postoperatively in the General Ward, High
Dependency Units or outpatient clinics (based on patient condition).

## Inclusion criteria

The study population will comprise of adult patients undergoing any of the
following surgical procedures:

- Diversion or resective colonic surgery
  - Right hemicolectomy
  - Left hemicolectomy
  - Total colectomy
  - Lower Anterior Resection
  - Abdomino-perineal resection
- Pancreatic Procedures
  - Whipple procedure
  - Distal Pancreatectomy

## Data Collection and Management

Pertinent patient variables that will be collected are:

- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Functional Status
- Whether surgery is emergent
- ASA Class
- Steroid use for chronic condition
- Ascites within last 30 days prior to presentation
- Systematic sepsis within previous 48 hours
- Presence of congestive heart failure on presentation
- Presence of acute renal failure on presentation
- Presence of disseminated cancer
- Presence of diabetes (none, on oral hypoglycemics, on insulin)
- Presence of hypertension requiring medication
- Current Smoker for last one year
- Presence of severe COPD
- Dialysis Dependent
- Ventilator requirement 48 hours prior to planned surgery

These variables will be collected on a preformed performa. The data gathered by
the performa will be entered into the [ACS risk
calculator](https://riskcalculator.facs.org). The risk of each of the following
outcomes will be noted:

- Pneumonia
- Cardiac Complication
- Surgical Site Infection
- Urinary Tract Infection
- Renal Failure
- Ileus
- Anastomotic Leak
- Return to Operating Room
- Serious Complication

The patients will be followed for 90 days postoperatively for the occurrence of
the same outcomes  at 30 and 90 days postoperatively. These data will be stored
online in the form of spreadsheet under password protection. Once data
collection is complete, hard copies of the performas will be destroyed. Data
will be anonymised in order to protect patient privacy.

## Duration of Study

One to two years after the approval of synopsis.

## Sample Size

-- to be calculated --

## Duration of Study

Non-probability consecutive sampling.

## Data Analysis

The statistical analysis will be performed using the R statistical programming
language and environment. Distributions of the predicted probabilities of
mortality as well as each morbidity will be plotted. Receiver operating curves
will be plotted for these distributions by comparing the estimated probabilities
of each outcome with the actual observed outcomes and the area under the curve
will be calculated. Data will be gathered prospectively.

# Expected Outcomes of the Study

Provision of surgical risk calculator in the emergency setting will be a
tremendous asset to patients. The risk calculator will assist in weighing the
risks and benefits of the emergency surgery by providing the probability of
adverse outcomes. It will aid patients in justifying the cost of the surgical
procedure. It will aid surgeons in tailoring selection of candidates for surgery
in cases where benefits of surgery are equivocal.

# Dissemination of Results

Results are intended to be submitted for publication as free access so that the
risk calculator may be freely available to surgeons across for application.
Study results will be reported in accordance with the STROBE guidelines.
